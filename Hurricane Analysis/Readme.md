# Hurricane Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing data about hurricanes to extract meaningful insights. It was developed as part of Codecademy's Python learning path, offering learners an opportunity to practice data manipulation, conditionals, loops, and more.

## Project Overview

The **Hurricane Analysis** project involves working with a dataset containing information about historical hurricanes. The primary goal is to implement functions that:

- Organize and structure hurricane data.
- Perform calculations to determine metrics such as the deadliest hurricane and total damage.
- Convert and standardize data for easier analysis.

## Features

Key functionalities of this project include:

1. **Categorizing Hurricanes by Year**: Group hurricanes into a dictionary based on the year they occurred.
2. **Identifying the Deadliest Hurricane**: Find the hurricane with the highest number of deaths.
3. **Damage Conversion**: Standardize damage values into numeric formats for easier comparison (e.g., millions to integers).
4. **Categorizing Hurricanes by Damage**: Classify hurricanes based on the extent of their damage.

## Files

- **Hurricane Analysis.ipynb**: The notebook where the analysis and functions are implemented.
- **Hurricane Analysis_Solution.ipynb**: A solution notebook provided by Codecademy for comparison and reference.

## Skills Practiced

- Data structures: Working with dictionaries and lists.
- Conditionals and loops.
- Data standardization and cleaning.
- Basic algorithm implementation.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of Codecademy's **Python for Data Analysis** curriculum. Thanks to Codecademy for providing a structured learning path and sample data for practice.
